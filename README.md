phpbb-bridge-codeigniter
========================

I was doing a project and i need  forum in the project. Instead of making own forum i decided to use the forum which would had all things. so i did little research for the forum which can be easily integrated in codiginiter Framework. I found PHPBB was best forum with all the things as i wants. So I also search the way to integrate it in codigniter.After doing little serach i found the library which works as bridge between framework application and forum.http://ellislab.com/forums/viewthread/125350/P15. I had to modify  the library as my need so i did the work  as the old one was not complete.
